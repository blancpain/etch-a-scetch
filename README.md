# Etch-a-scetch

## Overview 
Simple Etch-a-scetch project that is super fun.

This is the second "large" project for me using JS. This one took a while and had me looking back at past lessons and using Google quite a lot. Happy with the results but defenitely some room for enhancements.

## Learnings
I have learned quite a lot coding this from scratch. Some of the main takeaways include using JS for DOM manipulation, learning more about event handlers/listeners and callback functions in general, and using loops and functions.
