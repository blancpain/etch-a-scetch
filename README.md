# Etch-a-scetch

## Overview 
Simple Etch-a-scetch project that is super fun.

This is the second "large" project for me using JS. This one took a while and had me looking back at past lessons and using Google quite a lot. Happy with the results but defenitely some room for enhancements.

## Learnings
I have learned quite a lot building this from scratch. Some of the main takeaways include using JS for DOM manipulation, learning more about event handlers/listeners and callback functions in general, and using loops and functions. In addition, I've also explored some unknown territories related to CSS and HTML (e.g. range sliders, color pickers, using CSS variables etc).
